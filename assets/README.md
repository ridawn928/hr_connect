This directory contains all the static assets used by the HR Connect application.

## Directory Structure

### images/

### icons/
Contains custom icons specific to HR Connect, including status indicators, feature icons, and other UI elements.

### config/
Holds environment-specific configuration files for different deployment environments (development, staging, production).

### translations/
Contains localization files for supporting multiple languages as required by the HR Connect PRD.

### fonts/
Contains the Roboto font family files used as the primary font throughout the application.

## Font Requirements

The following font files need to be added to the `fonts` directory:

- Roboto-Regular.ttf
- Roboto-Medium.ttf
- Roboto-Bold.ttf

These can be downloaded from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) or the [Google Fonts GitHub repository](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/main/apache/roboto).

**Note:** Currently, the directories contain `.gitkeep` files to maintain the directory structure in version control. These files can be removed once actual assets are added to each directory.
