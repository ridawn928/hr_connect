# Task ID: 8
# Title: Offline Capabilities and Synchronization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance the offline-first approach with robust synchronization mechanisms.
# Details:
Implement background synchronization with WorkManager. Create conflict detection and resolution mechanisms using operational transforms. Develop a prioritized sync queue with business importance ordering. Implement the SyncProfile aggregate for tracking synchronization status. Add clear offline status indicators in the UI. Ensure all features function completely offline within the 7-day limit. Implement high-priority sync for attendance records.

# Test Strategy:
Test offline functionality across all features. Verify synchronization works correctly after connectivity is restored. Test conflict resolution with predefined conflict scenarios. Validate background sync efficiency and battery impact. Test the system behavior at the 7-day offline limit.
