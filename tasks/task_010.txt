# Task ID: 10
# Title: Testing and Deployment Preparation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing across all layers and prepare for deployment.
# Details:
Implement domain layer tests for entities, value objects, and business rules. Create data layer tests for repositories and synchronization logic. Develop presentation layer tests for UI components and state management. Implement integration tests for complete feature slices. Add performance tests for memory efficiency and battery impact. Set up feature flags for gradual rollout. Configure analytics and monitoring. Prepare app store submission materials including screenshots and descriptions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify test coverage across all layers meets requirements. Run integration tests to validate end-to-end workflows. Perform performance testing with large datasets. Test on minimum supported platforms (Android 8.0+, iOS 13.0+). Validate the application against all technical and business constraints from section 7.
