# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Architecture Foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the Flutter project with the required dependencies and establish the Modified Vertical Slice Architecture (MVSA) foundation.
# Details:
Create a new Flutter 3.29+ project with Dart 3.7+. Set up the project structure following the MVSA pattern with core and features directories. Configure the pubspec.yaml with all required dependencies from section 8. Implement the dependency injection system using get_it and injectable. Set up the basic routing system and application entry points. Create the architectural blueprint documentation for the team.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project structure matches MVSA requirements. Ensure all dependencies are correctly configured and can be imported. Create basic widget tests to verify the application can run. Implement CI pipeline for automated testing.
