# Task ID: 4
# Title: QR Code Attendance System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the QR code generation and scanning functionality for attendance tracking.
# Details:
Integrate Mobile Scanner for QR code reading and QR Flutter for code generation. Implement time-based QR codes with embedded timestamps and digital signatures. Create the validation logic for QR codes with configurable time windows (15 minutes default). Develop the AttendanceProfile aggregate for storing attendance records. Implement status classification (ON_TIME, LATE, etc.) with configurable grace periods. Create UI components for QR code scanning and display.

# Test Strategy:
Test QR code generation with various parameters. Verify QR code validation logic with different timestamps. Test offline validation capabilities. Create widget tests for QR scanning UI. Validate security measures including nonce tracking to prevent replay attacks.
