# Task ID: 3
# Title: Authentication and Device Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the authentication system and device management capabilities.
# Details:
Create the AuthenticationProfile aggregate with JWT-based authentication. Implement login, logout, and token refresh mechanisms. Set up Firebase Authentication integration for optional social login. Develop the DeviceProfile aggregate for device registration and verification. Implement the device limitation logic (max 2 devices per employee). Create the UI components for authentication flows including login, password reset, and device registration screens.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flows with mock credentials. Verify token refresh mechanism works correctly. Test device registration and verification process. Implement widget tests for authentication UI components. Validate security constraints like session timeout after 8 hours of inactivity.
