# Task ID: 5
# Title: Employee Profile Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the employee profile management system with all related aggregates.
# Details:
Create the Employee entity as the primary aggregate root. Implement the EmploymentProfile for job details and organizational placement. Develop the PerformanceProfile for goals, KPIs, and reviews. Create the UI components for profile viewing and editing. Implement document upload and management with Firebase Storage. Add profile image handling with caching. Ensure all sensitive employee data is encrypted at rest.

# Test Strategy:
Test entity creation and validation rules for all profile aggregates. Verify data persistence and retrieval. Test document upload and download functionality. Create widget tests for profile UI components. Validate field-level encryption for sensitive information.
