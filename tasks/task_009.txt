# Task ID: 9
# Title: UI/UX Implementation with Material Design 3
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the user interface following Material Design 3 guidelines with responsive layouts.
# Details:
Implement Material Design 3 components throughout the application. Create responsive layouts for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Add offline status indicators in the UI. Implement permission-aware UI components that adapt based on user role. Develop optimistic UI updates with sync status indicators. Create memory-efficient list views with pagination. Standardize error and empty states across the application. Ensure loading state consistency.

# Test Strategy:
Create golden tests for visual consistency. Test responsive layouts on different screen sizes. Verify UI adaptation based on permissions. Test optimistic UI updates and error state handling. Validate accessibility compliance with screen readers and contrast requirements.
