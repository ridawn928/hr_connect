# Task ID: 2
# Title: Core Infrastructure Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core shared infrastructure including local storage, network layer, and security foundation.
# Details:
Set up Flutter Data with Drift for local storage. Configure Firebase integration for cloud synchronization. Implement the repository pattern for data access abstraction. Create the network layer with Dio including interceptors for authentication and error handling. Implement the security foundation with JWT handling, secure storage, and encryption utilities. Set up the error handling system using the Either type pattern from Dartz.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for repository implementations with mocked data sources. Test local storage operations with sample data. Verify encryption and decryption functionality. Test network layer with mock responses. Validate error handling across different scenarios.
