# Task ID: 6
# Title: Time Management Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the comprehensive time management system including leave management and requests.
# Details:
Create the RequestProfile aggregate for leave, overtime, and other requests. Implement leave management with different types (emergency, personal, sick, vacation, etc.). Develop approval workflows with escalation for disapproved requests. Implement overtime request processing with configurable limits. Create UI components for leave requests, approval interfaces, and team schedule visualization. Implement time-based business rules (24h emergency leave, 30-day personal leave).

# Test Strategy:
Test leave request creation and validation. Verify approval workflows function correctly. Test business rule enforcement for different leave types. Create widget tests for time management UI components. Validate offline capabilities for leave requests.
