## 3. Folder Structure Planning

### 3.1 Documentation Folder Structure
Create the following folder structure at the project root:

```
/docs
  /architecture             # Architecture documentation
    /diagrams               # Architecture diagrams
    /examples               # Code examples
  /api                      # API documentation
  /user-guides              # End-user documentation
  /development              # Developer guides
    /setup                  # Development environment setup
    /workflows              # Development workflows
    /standards              # Coding standards and guidelines
  /assets                   # Shared documentation assets
    /images                 # Shared images
    /diagrams               # Shared diagrams
  README.md                 # Documentation index
```

### 3.2 Purpose of Each Folder

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `/docs/architecture` | Contains architecture documentation created in task 01-005-03, including MVSA pattern, folder structure, DI, state management, etc. |
| `/docs/architecture/diagrams` | Stores architecture diagrams (component diagrams, flow charts, etc.) |
| `/docs/architecture/examples` | Contains code examples illustrating architecture concepts |
| `/docs/api` | API documentation, endpoint definitions, etc. |
| `/docs/user-guides` | End-user documentation and guides |
| `/docs/development` | Developer-focused documentation |
| `/docs/development/setup` | Environment setup instructions |
| `/docs/development/workflows` | Development processes and workflows |
| `/docs/development/standards` | Coding standards, guidelines, and best practices |
| `/docs/assets` | Shared assets used across multiple documentation files |
| `/docs/assets/images` | Shared images for documentation |
| `/docs/assets/diagrams` | Shared diagrams for documentation |

### 3.3 Documentation Organization Principles

1. **Group by Purpose**: Documentation is organized by its primary purpose (architecture, API, user guides, etc.)
2. **Proximity Principle**: Related documents are kept together
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Different types of documentation are kept separate
4. **Asset Management**: Documentation assets are organized for reuse and easy maintenance
5. **Discoverability**: Structure facilitates easy navigation and discovery

## 4. Implementation Steps

### 4.1 Step 1: Create Folder Structure

Start by creating the basic folder structure using the command line:

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd /path/to/hr_connect

# Create main docs folder
mkdir -p docs

# Create architecture documentation folders (for task 01-005-03 content)
mkdir -p docs/architecture/diagrams docs/architecture/examples

# Create other documentation folders
mkdir -p docs/api docs/user-guides
mkdir -p docs/development/setup docs/development/workflows docs/development/standards
mkdir -p docs/assets/images docs/assets/diagrams
```

Alternatively, you can create the folder structure through your IDE or file explorer.

### 4.2 Step 2: Create Documentation Index

Create a main README.md file in the docs folder to serve as the documentation index:

```bash
touch docs/README.md
```

Add the following content to the README.md file:

```markdown
# HR Connect Documentation

This folder contains the comprehensive documentation for the HR Connect application.

## Contents

- [Architecture Documentation](./architecture/README.md)
  - Application architecture and design patterns
  - Component diagrams and system architecture
  - Data models and relationships

- [API Documentation](./api/README.md)
  - API endpoints and usage
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Data formats and schemas

- [User Guides](./user-guides/README.md)
  - End-user documentation
  - Feature guides and tutorials
  - Frequently asked questions

- [Development Documentation](./development/README.md)
  - Development environment setup
  - Development workflows and processes
  - Coding standards and guidelines

## Quick Links

- [Architecture Overview](./architecture/mvsa-overview.md)
- [Development Setup](./development/setup/getting-started.md)
- [Coding Standards](./development/standards/coding-standards.md)
```

### 4.3 Step 3: Create README.md for Each Subfolder

Create a README.md file in each subfolder to explain its purpose and contents:

```bash
# Create README.md files for each major section
touch docs/architecture/README.md
touch docs/api/README.md
touch docs/user-guides/README.md
touch docs/development/README.md
touch docs/development/setup/README.md
touch docs/development/workflows/README.md
touch docs/development/standards/README.md
```

Example content for `docs/architecture/README.md`:

```markdown
# Architecture Documentation

This folder contains the comprehensive architecture documentation for the HR Connect application.

## Contents

- [MVSA Overview](./mvsa-overview.md) - Overview of the Modified Vertical Slice Architecture
- [Folder Structure](./folder-structure.md) - Project organization and structure
- [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.md) - DI implementation with get_it and injectable
- [State Management](./state-management.md) - Riverpod state management approach
- [Coding Standards](./coding-standards.md) - Development conventions and best practices

## Diagrams

Architecture diagrams can be found in the [diagrams](./diagrams) folder.

## Examples

Code examples illustrating architecture concepts can be found in the [examples](./examples) folder.
```

### 4.4 Step 4: Move Architecture Documentation Files

Move the architecture documentation files created in task 01-005-03 to the appropriate location:

```bash
# Move architecture documentation files (adjust filenames as needed)
mv path/to/mvsa-overview.md docs/architecture/
mv path/to/folder-structure.md docs/architecture/
mv path/to/dependency-injection.md docs/architecture/
mv path/to/state-management.md docs/architecture/
mv path/to/coding-standards.md docs/architecture/

# Move any diagrams to the diagrams folder
mv path/to/diagrams/* docs/architecture/diagrams/

# Move any examples to the examples folder
mv path/to/examples/* docs/architecture/examples/
```

### 4.5 Step 5: Update Internal Links

After moving documentation files, ensure all internal links are updated to reflect the new folder structure. This may involve:

1. Updating relative links between documentation files
2. Updating image and diagram references
3. Ensuring cross-references between documents are maintained

For example, change:
```markdown
For more information, see [Dependency Injection](./dependency-injection.md).
```

To:
```markdown
For more information, see [Dependency Injection](../architecture/dependency-injection.md).
```

when referenced from a file outside the architecture folder.

### 4.6 Step 6: Add Documentation to Version Control

Add the documentation to version control:

```bash
# Add all documentation files to git
git add docs/

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Place documentation in /docs folder at project root (Task 01-005-04)"

# Push changes to remote repository
git push
```

## 5. Documentation File Management

### 5.1 File Naming Conventions

Follow these naming conventions for documentation files:

| Item | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Folder names | Lowercase with hyphens | `user-guides` |
| File names | Lowercase with hyphens | `mvsa-overview.md` |
| README files | All caps | `README.md` |
| Image files | Descriptive names with hyphens | `architecture-overview-diagram.png` |

### 5.2 Asset Management

1. **Image Handling**:
   - Store images in the appropriate assets folder
   - Use descriptive filenames
   - Optimize images for web viewing
   - Consider using relative paths for images

   ```markdown
   ![Architecture Overview](../../assets/diagrams/architecture-overview.png)
   ```

2. **Diagram Management**:
   - Store diagrams as both source files (if applicable) and rendered images
   - For Mermaid diagrams, include the Mermaid code in the markdown file
   - For complex diagrams, maintain source files (e.g., draw.io files) alongside exported images

3. **Code Examples**:
   - Store code examples with appropriate syntax highlighting
   - Consider using separate files for extensive code examples

### 5.3 Link Management

1. **Internal Links**:
   - Use relative paths for links between documentation files
   - Start with `./` for files in the same directory
   - Use `../` to navigate up directories

   ```markdown
   [State Management](./state-management.md)
   [Architecture Overview](../architecture/mvsa-overview.md)
   ```

2. **External Links**:
   - Use absolute URLs for external resources
   - Consider adding a note if links point to external resources

   ```markdown
   [Flutter Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
   ```

3. **Anchor Links**:
   - Use anchor links to reference specific sections within a document

   ```markdown
   [Dependency Injection Setup](#dependency-injection-setup)
   ```

## 6. Best Practices for Documentation Organization

### 6.1 Documentation Structure

1. **Consistent Headers**: Use consistent heading levels throughout documentation
   - Level 1 (`#`) for document title
   - Level 2 (`##`) for major sections
   - Level 3 (`###`) for subsections
   - Level 4 (`####`) for detailed points

2. **Table of Contents**: Include a table of contents for longer documents

   ```markdown
   ## Table of Contents
   - [Introduction](#introduction)
   - [Architecture Overview](#architecture-overview)
   - [Components](#components)
   ```

3. **Consistent Sections**: Use consistent section structures across similar documents

### 6.2 Documentation Maintenance

1. **Single Source of Truth**: Keep documentation in one place to avoid duplication
2. **Regular Updates**: Update documentation when code changes
3. **Documentation Reviews**: Include documentation in code reviews
4. **Ownership**: Assign ownership for documentation maintenance

### 6.3 Integration with Project Workflow

1. **Documentation Updates**: Ensure documentation updates are part of the development process
2. **Documentation Review**: Include documentation checks in pull request reviews
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Consider adding documentation validation to CI/CD pipeline

## 7. Testing and Verification

### 7.1 Documentation Validation

Verify that:
- All documentation files are placed in the correct locations
- Folder structure matches the planned organization
- README.md files exist in each folder
- Links between documents work correctly
- Images and diagrams are properly displayed

### 7.2 Link Checking

Validate internal links using a link checker tool or manual testing:
- Ensure all relative links correctly point to their targets
- Check that anchor links point to the correct headings
- Verify that asset links (images, diagrams) work correctly

### 7.3 Markdown Rendering

Check that:
- Markdown renders correctly in the expected viewers (GitHub, IDE, etc.)
- Code blocks are properly formatted with syntax highlighting
- Tables render correctly
