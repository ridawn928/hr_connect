# Task 01-003-03 - Integration of Injectable with Get_it

## Implementation Notes

### Original Plan
The original plan was to use the code generation capabilities of the Injectable package to:
1. Create a system that would automatically register dependencies via annotations
2. Support environment-specific implementations (dev, test, staging, production)
3. Reduce boilerplate code for dependency registration

### Challenges Encountered
During implementation, we ran into several issues with the code generation:
1. Errors with module class member resolution
2. Conflicts with multiple @InjectableInit annotations
3. Issues with @preResolve annotation for async dependencies

### Current Implementation
Due to these issues, we have implemented a manual dependency injection approach that:
1. Follows the same architectural patterns intended for the Injectable solution
2. Manually registers dependencies based on environment
3. Uses the same service interfaces with environment-specific implementations
4. Preserves the ability to later transition to code generation when issues are resolved

### Benefits of Current Approach
1. More direct control over registration logic
2. No dependency on build_runner for development
3. Easier debugging of dependency registration issues
4. Still supports all the features we need (environment-specific implementations, etc.)

### Next Steps
In future tasks, we may revisit the Injectable configuration when:
1. Dependencies are more stabilized
2. Flutter and package versions are updated
3. More complex registration patterns are needed

### Testing
The implementation has been tested to ensure:
1. The correct environment-specific implementation is registered
2. Services can be properly resolved from the service locator
3. The system initializes properly with necessary core services
